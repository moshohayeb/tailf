We need to determine Player ID for the friendly (us):
    TRANSITIONING card [name=Reinforce id=5 zone=PLAY zonePos=0 cardId=CS2_101 player=1] to OPPOSING PLAY (Hero Power)
    TRANSITIONING card [id=29 cardId= type=INVALID zone=DECK zonePos=0 player=1] to OPPOSING DECK
    TRANSITIONING card [id=6 cardId= type=INVALID zone=DECK zonePos=0 player=1] to OPPOSING DECK
        -> OPPOSING DECK and extract player=X


To determine hand:
    TRANSITIONING card [name=The Coin id=68 zone=HAND zonePos=5 cardId=GAME_005 player=2] to FRIENDLY HAND
    TRANSITIONING card [name=Holy Smite id=63 zone=HAND zonePos=1 cardId=CS1_130 player=2] to FRIENDLY HAND

    1294 TRANSITIONING card [name=Twilight Whelp id=44 zone=HAND zonePos=0 cardId=BRM_004 player=2] to FRIENDLY HAND
    id=3 local=False [name=Twilight Whelp id=44 zone=HAND zonePos=0 cardId=BRM_004 player=2] zone from FRIENDLY DECK -> FRIENDLY HAND
        -> Received Twilight Whelp from my deck into my hand (FRIENDLY HAND should be on the right side)

To determine Opponent hand:
    1398, id=4 local=False [id=11 cardId= type=INVALID zone=HAND zonePos=0 player=1] zone from OPPOSING DECK -> OPPOSING HAND
    1402, id=4 local=False [id=11 cardId= type=INVALID zone=HAND zonePos=4 player=1] pos from 0 -> 4


To determine space:
    id=3 local=False [name=Twilight Whelp id=44 zone=HAND zonePos=2 cardId=BRM_004 player=2] pos from 0 -> 2
        -> 0 is
        -> 2 is
